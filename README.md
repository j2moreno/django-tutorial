# Django tutorial 

This repo follows the tutorial by the django team documented here https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/. 

The tutorial, helps one with the creation of a basic poll application.

Itâ€™ll consist of two parts:
- A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
- An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.
